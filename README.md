# SQL-Portfolio-Projects
This repository provides a sample of data analysis work I completed using SQL and includes the following:

1. Answer questions based on the Credit Card Transactions
download credit card transactions dataset from below link :
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/analyzing-credit-card-spending-habits-in-india
import the dataset in sql server with table name : credit_card_transcations
change the column names to lower case before importing data to sql server.Also replace space within column names with underscore.

2. There are 2 csv files present in this zip file. The data contains 120 years of olympics history. There are 2 daatsets 
   a. athletes : it has information about all the players participated in olympics
   b. athlete_events : it has information about all the events happened over the year.(athlete id refers to the id column in athlete table)
